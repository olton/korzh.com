The technology was created in 1995.\r\n\r\nIt is relatively easy to learn, and there are many free training resources available.\r\nIn addition, there is an enormous community that can help a newbie through the learning process.\r\nJava is suitable for almost every type of project: web applications, mobile apps, cloud computing, etc.\r\n\r\n<Image src={appOfJavaImage} alt=\"Applications of Java\" />\r\n\r\nJava is a free technology, as is the Oracle JDK (Java Development Kit), or Oracle OpenJDK, that’s used to create software in Java.\r\nIt also makes it possible to work with other programming languages, such as Kotlin, Groovy, or Scala, which would be relatively easy to learn as an addition. And as we have just pointed out, the job market is full of offers for Java developers from all over the planet. Sound good?\r\n\r\nBut hold on — there is a slippery slope under any ideal image. Some downsides include:\r\n\r\n### Licesing mess\r\n\r\nMaybe you think that you will start your way in Java by writing a small \"Hello World\" program, right? Wrong.\r\nToday, before you actually can learn Java itself, you first need to understand licensing on this platform.\r\nOtherwise, you may appear in a situation when you at first have to pay Oracle a couple of thousands of dollars for the licensing before delivering your work to the customer.\r\nTherefore, first, carefully study what Oracle JDK is and how it differs from Oracle Open JDK.\r\nAnd how they both differ from the community-led AdoptOpenJDK.\r\nWhat is Binary Code License and how much rights you have with [GPLv2+CPE license](http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html).\r\nSeveral official FAQs seem to explain the situation with licensing (one on [Oracle’s site](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/oracle-jdk-faqs.html)\r\nand another one on [Java.com](https://java.com/en/download/faq/distribution.xml)) but make it even more confusing.\r\nIn addition, you can easily find a bunch of blog posts, queries on Quora (like \"Is Java still free\"), and even videos on this topic.\r\n\r\nThe question is: do you really want to deal with all this?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Legacy code\r\n\r\nMany long-standing companies have something written in Java.\r\nEventually, a young and passionate Java learner might end up on a job where they are working with an obsolete code instead of some new and prominent technology.\r\nFor example, a library a company has been accumulating for 20 odd years might be too expensive and time-consuming to modernize.\r\n\r\n\r\n### High competition\r\n\r\nIn addition to the huge number of vacancies, there’s an even bigger number of candidates.\r\nThat’s because virtually everyone who studies all the ratings sees Java in the top positions — and here we go!\r\nAnother thousand newbie learners opt for Java.\r\n\r\n\r\n## A More Promising Option: the .NET Framework\r\n\r\nThere is another very popular free open-source developer platform that can serve you better — .NET. Here is why it may be more promising for you.\r\n\r\n<Image src={dotNetImage} alt=\".NET 5 platform overview\" />\r\n\r\nSource: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/\r\n\r\n### 1. Free, open, and cross-platform\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, about five to six years ago all the features mentioned in the previous section would have made Java a better option,\r\nas .NET was then fully controlled by Microsoft and ran only on Windows.\r\n\r\n__This situation has completely changed in the last few years.__\r\n\r\nThe tables have turned, and now Java is becoming more closed off under Oracle guidance, while the approach of Microsoft is quite the opposite.\r\n.NET now is an [open-source platform with no licensing costs](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/free).\r\nThey claim freedom for developers as one of the platform’s core values.\r\nFor the time being, Microsoft seems to practice what they preach.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the .NET platform — .NET Core — is compatible with all the major operating systems: Windows, Linux, and iOS. There are basic .NET tools open for immediate use and lots of add-ons for building and editing apps, as well as third-party tools. Multiple libraries built specifically for .NET make the development process even more comfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. All application types\r\n\r\nThe .NET framework (and its Core edition in particular) allow you to develop almost any kind of application,\r\nbe it an enterprise-level web app, desktop or mobile software, gaming project, or even an IoT service or an AI solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the WebAssembly technology and [Blazor framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor),\r\n.NET can be used even for building client-side applications running in a browser — web apps where both client and server-side code is written in C#, thus eliminating the need to use JavaScript.\r\n\r\n<Image src={dotModelImage} alt=\".NET 5 application models\" />\r\n\r\nSource: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet\r\n\r\n\r\n### 3. Quick progress and regular updates\r\n\r\nThe .NET framework has been constantly evolving throughout its 20-year history.\r\nBut in the last four to five years, the pace of its progress has increased significantly.\r\n\r\nSince the initial release of .NET Core back in 2016, we have received a major update almost once per year.\r\n\r\nIn November 2020 Microsoft plans to release another big update to the platform — .NET 5.\r\nIt is supposed to take the best of the previous versions and become a united platform for all the development tasks.\r\nMoreover, at its annual conference in 2019 Microsoft introduced [a roadmap for the .NET platform](https://medium.com/capgemini-dynamics-365-team/future-of-net-net-5-microsoft-build-2019-from-a-net-developer-point-of-view-7a1158fb0691)\r\nthat gives a clear understanding of what to expect and when.\r\n\r\n<Image src={dotScheduleImage} alt=\".NET Schedule\" />\r\n\r\nSource: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/\r\n\r\n\r\n### 4. Great performance\r\n\r\nFor years, the applications created either with Java or on .NET/C# had a similar level of performance.\r\nHowever, Microsoft and many third-party contributers have made some significant investments in the optimization of this aspect and continues to improve.\r\nFor example, the ASP.NET Core web framework allows you to serve [7 million requests per second on a single server](https://www.ageofascent.com/2019/02/04/asp-net-core-saturating-10gbe-at-7-million-requests-per-second/).\r\nAnd according to [TechEmpower tests](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&hw=ph&test=json), ASP.NET Core is way ahead of any Java web framework.\r\n\r\nHere's another good demonstration of the performance that can be achieved on the .NET platform —\r\n[an example of a super-fast network driver written in different languages](https://github.com/ixy-languages/ixy-languages).\r\nThe driver written in C# shows almost the same level of performance as C and Rust, slightly better than the Go language, and way ahead of all other high-level languages, including Java.\r\n\r\n### 5. C# — modern and versatile\r\n\r\n.NET was initially designed to support many programming languages.\r\nThe most widely employed among them are C# (pronounced “see sharp”) and F# (which offers a more functional approach).\r\n\r\nThe most popular and loved is definitely C# — a general-purpose and object-oriented programming language.\r\nIt is easy to learn and is widely used for all kinds of software development, from enterprise-level solutions to low-level IoT and gaming projects.\r\nIt makes simple many features that are overly complicated in Java.\r\n\r\nDespite its long history, C# keeps up with the times.\r\nA lot of features, such as LINQ queries, lambda expressions, asynchronous operations with async/await, and others were introduced in C# way ahead of other programming languages. Java still doesn’t have many features that were available in C# for years.\r\n\r\n## .NET Limitations\r\n\r\nJust like we said about Java, there is always a downside to any ideal picture.\r\nWith .NET, it is still not good enough for the client-side development.\r\nJavaScript is still considered the best option.\r\nThe same goes for the ML (Machine Learning) and NLP (Natural Language Processing) applications. Here Python is number one.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Wrap Up\r\n\r\nThe choice between Java and .NET is one between two solid enterprise-level development options.\r\nThough Java now ranks number one in all the ratings, it is highly competitive in terms of the job market and slow in terms of relevant updates.\r\n\r\nThe other option — .NET — is an open-source object-oriented solution that can be used for developing all sorts of applications, and it has a clear roadmap for the future.\r\nIn 2020 there will emerge .NET 5, an update that will unite all the best features of the previous .NET versions.\r\nThis makes learning a well-structured, easy, and modern technology even more attractive.\r\n\r\n### Useful links:\r\n\r\n* Looking for a job as a .NET developer? <br />\r\nUse [Jooble](https://jooble.org/jobs-.net-developer) to post your CV and start getting job offers.\r\n\r\n* Need to implement CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations in your ASP.NET Core project and don't know where to start? <br />\r\n[EasyData open-source library](https://github.com/KorzhCom/EasyData) to the rescue!
