Choosing the same location for both is convenient only for very small applications. Once you start adding other layers to your solution (domain classes, data layers, API, etc.), having them in separate projects will be more practical.\r\n\r\n> __Tip #2__: Use the general name of your application for the name of the solution (like “MyCoolApp”) and add the “.Web” suffix for the project name (e.g., “MyCoolApp.Web”).\r\n\r\n<div id=\"projectCreationFinalStep\">\r\n    Finally, you will need to choose some additional project options.\r\n\r\n    <Image src={infoProjectImage} alt=\"Additional information for the new project\" />\r\n\r\n    The most important options here are:\r\n\r\n    * __Target Framework__. I suggest selecting the latest one (for the moment), .NET 5, but all the information in this article is relevant for .NET Core 3.1 or .NET 6 (it’s in the pre-release state now) projects as well.\r\n    * __Authentication Type__. In this article, we suppose this option is set to *Individual Accounts*. This value means that our new web project will contain some means for managing user accounts and provide UI for the basic authentication operations: Login, Registration, Reset Password, etc.\r\n\r\n    Let's click on \"Create\" when everything is set and get our new solution.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the steps described above, you will get a new solution with one project inside it.\r\n\r\nThe structure of that project will look similar (or even the same) to the following one:\r\n\r\n<Image src={structureProjectImage} alt=\"Default ASP.NET Core project structure\" />\r\n\r\nLet’s take a closer look at each part of your new project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1. Connected Services\r\n\r\nThis is the first node in your project’s structure and possibly the less-used one.\r\nIt is intended to automate the multiple steps necessary to connect a project to an external service (like Azure Storage or Application Insights).\r\nYou can right-click on this node and select “Add connected service…” to run a wizard that will lead you through the process.\r\nUsually, it just adds necessary packages and gives you basic instructions on how to start using your app's service.\r\nAs I’ve already mentioned, there is a good chance you will not use this node during your project’s lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis element of your project structure contains all packets or other projects on which your project depends.\r\n\r\nThere are four main folders inside this node:\r\n\r\n* __Analyzers__\r\nThey help you make your code better: cleaner, error-free. Each analyzer checks that your code satisfies a list of rules incorporated in it. If any part of your code does not apply to one of the rules, you will see either a Warning or an Error while you build your project.\r\n\r\nPlease note that analyzers work only at compile time and do not affect your resulting application.\r\n\r\n* __Frameworks__\r\nThis folder contains a list of frameworks your project depends on. This information is important if you [publish your web app as a runtime-dependent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/) (as opposed to a self-contained one). In this case, all the frameworks listed here must be installed on the server where you will run your app.\r\n\r\n> NB: You can use `dotnet --info` console command to check the list of installed frameworks.*\r\n\r\n* __Packages__ This is the main item in this node. It lists all NuGet packages you added (installed) to your project. If any of those packages depend on other packages, they will be installed automatically and listed as sub-nodes of the root-level packages. You can remove each installed package here (right-click / Remove).\r\n* __Projects__ This is the list of other projects in this solution your current project depends on.\r\nYou can reference other projects using the “Add reference” command from the right-click menu.\r\nObviously, this node is empty now since we have only one project in the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 3. Properties\r\n\r\nThis part contains different properties of your project that you can modify by double-clicking on this node in the Solution Explorer. Most of the properties there affect the compile- and debug-time behavior of your project.\r\n\r\nThe only item inside this node is a “launchSettings.json” file containing the launch profiles. Each profile defines how to run your project when you click on the “Run” button in Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n### 4. wwwroot\r\n\r\nThis folder contains all the static files of your web application: CSS files, JavaScript files, images, and icons.\r\nAs you might figure out from its name, this will be the root folder of your web app.\r\nSo if you put an “image1.png” file into the “wwwroot/images/dir1” folder, it will be accessible in the browser by the “/images/dir/image1.png” address.\r\n\r\n### 5. Areas\r\n\r\nThis folder is added because we selected the “Individual Accounts” value for the “Authentication Type” option when created the project.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the core authentication/authorization packages (which is called ASP.NET Core Identity), the default template also adds the “Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UI” package. This is a Razor-class library that contains all forms and partial views for authentication and user management: Login, Registration, Reset Password, User Profile, and many others.\r\nAll these forms will use your layout (defined in *Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml*) and so will match your website’s design.\r\n\r\nHowever, you still might want to change some of those forms (or even all of them).\r\nIn this case, you can use the Scaffold command and add the necessary files to your project. The scaffolded files will be added to the *Areas/Identity* folder.\r\n\r\n### 6. Data\r\n\r\nAs in the previous case, this folder appears in our new project because of the “Authentication Type” option that was turned on at the beginning.\r\n\r\nBy default, all user-related information (users, their roles, claims, etc.) is stored in a database accessed with [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) ORM (object-relational mapping) framework. If you are not familiar with EF Core, you can find a lot of tutorials on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/).\r\n\r\nThe “Data” folder contains your DB context class named “ApplicationDbContext.” This class is derived from the “IdentityDbContext” class defined in the “Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore” assembly, and it includes all DB sets (tables) necessary to store user-related information.\r\n\r\nYou can use this class or create another DbContext class to add your models.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the “Data” folder also includes “Migrations” sub-folder with all your Entity Framework Core migrations.\r\n\r\n### 7. Pages\r\n\r\nThis folder contains all pages (forms) of your web applications. ASP.NET Core has two default approaches for content rendering: MVC (Model View Controller) and [Razor Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages) (which is, actually, a kind of MVC, where each controller and the corresponding view are stored together). Both approaches use [Razor syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor) that you can think of as HTML + C#.\r\n\r\nEach Razor page is represented by a “.cshtml” file. The code related to it is stored in a so-called “code-behind” file with the same name and a “.cshtml.cs” extension.\r\n\r\nFrom the start, the “Pages” folder contains a few default pages, such as Index (the home page of your web app), Privacy, and Error. Additionally, you can find the main layout file (_Layout.cshtml) and some partial views in the “Pages/Shared” folder.\r\n\r\n__NB__: It’s a common practice to prefix the names of the layouts and partial views with `_` symbol.\r\n\r\n### 8. Root Folder Files\r\n\r\nNow, when we’ve looked over all the main folders created with the default ASP.NET Core application template, let’s take a closer look at the files stored in the project’s root folder. They are the most important part of the project.\r\n\r\n#### Program.cs\r\n\r\nThis file defines the “Program” class with one static method, “Main,” which is the entry point of your web application.\r\n\r\nThe only purpose of this method is to define the [host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/?view=aspnetcore-3.1#host) and then pass the control to the Startup class. For more information about the default host builder, look at an article about [Generic Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host) on Microsoft’s Docs.\r\n\r\n#### application.settings\r\n\r\nThis is a JSON file that stores the application’s settings. The settings have a hierarchical structure and can be accessed with the Configuration object defined in the Startup class or in any other place of your program where you injected IConfiguration service. For example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar defaultLogLevel = Configuration.GetValue<string>(\"Logging:LogLevel:Default\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe different levels of hierarchy are separated by the colon (`:`) symbol.\r\n\r\nBy default, in addition to “application.settings”, the ASP.NET Core template also includes an “application.Development.settings” file.\r\nThe settings defined in this file are loaded only into the Development environment and are not available in production.\r\nTo learn more about the “.settings” files and configuration in ASP.NET Core projects in general, please read [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/) on Microsoft’s Docs.\r\n\r\n#### Startup.cs\r\n\r\nThis is the final part of the ASP.NET Core project’s structure. The “Startup” class serves three main purposes:\r\n\r\n* It performs all initialization tasks (setting application-wide constants, DB seeding, migrations, etc.).\r\n* It registers all services used in this project in the [DI (dependency injection) container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection).\r\n* It defines the [middleware pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection) of your web-application.\r\n\r\nThis class contains a lot of code (as for a project that has just been created) from the beginning and will become even bigger when you start adding new features to your application.\r\n\r\nWe will take a look at it in more detail in the [next article](asp-net-core-project-structure-explained-part2).";
